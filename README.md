# Catto App

Catto is a simple Android app that displays 10 random cat images fetched from the Cat API. The app's design is inspired by Pinterest, with a grid-like layout that showcases the images in a visually pleasing way.

## Features

- Fetches 10 random cat images from the Cat API and displays them in a grid-like layout.
- Allows users to tap on an image to view it in full screen mode.
- Uses Retrofit and Glide library for efficient network requests and image loading.
- Follows the MVVM architecture pattern for clean and maintainable code.
- Implements data binding for easy and efficient UI updates.
- Includes comments throughout the code to aid in understanding and future development.
